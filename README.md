# Adds a Glimpse tab for RouteLocalization

This tab can be used in combination with [RouteLocalization](https://github.com/Dresel/RouteLocalization/). Since Glimpse does not yet support Web API there is only a MVC implementation ready.

This tab is a simple copy & modification of the already existing Routes Tab but adds information of localized routes that might be useful for RouteLocalization debugging:
